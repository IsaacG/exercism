Hello World

What happens if you were to add `set -o nounset` to your code?

I decided I want two for me every time I give one away. Can you change the code so that you only need to edit the string ("one for me") once whenever you want to update it?


On LN you have an unquoted variable! That can lead to unexpected behavior.
$  bash ./two_fer.sh "a -o -n a"

Note you moved your logic out of main(). Generally, main() should contain all your logic.

In bash, prefer [[ over [. It's more powerful and less likely to act in unexpected ways. (For POSIX sh, stick to the [ operator.)

For arithmetic operations, prefer (( over [[. (( is an arithmetic operation while [[ is used for strings.

You got a lot of boilerplate comments left in there that would be nice to drop. It makes it harder to find your code.

Using a main() is good practice; it encapsulates a chunk of logic in one function which is good practice for when things get bigger.

- Don't use `exit` inside a function! Use `return 0` in case something else runs after calling this function.
